## PH-0 — Validation & Repository Foundation

### 2026-06-25 — PH-0 kickoff

**Done**
- Read and confirmed the planning package: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `agent-guardrails.md`,
  `claude-code-execution-package.md`, `phase-prompts.md`, `34-repository-structure.md`,
  `40-acceptance-criteria.md`, `42-open-decisions.md`.
- Produced `ph0-validation.md` (domain/module/role/core-loop understanding, OQ defaults, toolchain).
- Seeded `acceptance-audit.md` with AC-001…AC-066 → all `Pending` (no features yet).
- Verified local toolchain: .NET SDK 8.0.422 present (pinned via `global.json`), Node v26.3.1,
  Docker CLI 29.5.3, Git 2.54.0. SQL Server 8.0 runtime present.

**Decisions applied (OQ defaults + org answers 2026-06-25)**
- Env not air-gapped on build machine → direct NuGet/npm, public registry + digest pinning (OQ-031/032).
  Prod VM air-gap recorded as an open item for P16/P18 (offline images + mirror path), not a scaffold blocker.
- CI = GitHub Actions, GitHub-hosted runners for skeleton; "self-hosted runner for prod" → new OQ (OQ-038).
- TLS 1.2+ default, flag for security review at P16 (OQ-024).
- MFA: Chairman+Secretary required, 60-min idle — recorded, finalized at Keycloak setup (OQ-003).
- Standby: cold + documented restore, revisit P18 (OQ-020).
- Search: v1 = SQL Server FTS (ADR-0011 / R-24). Fallback if spike fails = **app-owned OpenSearch**
  (per ADR-0011), behind a search abstraction — NOT Meilisearch. See ph0-validation §Search-discrepancy.

**Open finding**
- Docker daemon was not running at PH-0 start (CLI present, Desktop Linux engine down). Started Docker
  Desktop; FTS spike + `docker compose up` proceed once the daemon is healthy.

**Next**
- Run Arabic FTS spike (OQ-034) and record result in `ph0-validation.md`.
- Scaffold P1 per `docs/34`; stop when `docker compose up` is healthy; report before P2.
