# ACMP Acceptance Audit

Every `AC-###` from `docs/validation/acceptance-criteria.md` → verdict. Keystone gate **G-PROGRESS**.
A requirement is not "done" until its AC is `Met` and traces to ≥1 test (gate **G-TRACE**).

**Verdicts:** `Met` · `Partial` · `Not-met` · `Pending` (not yet implemented).

> P13-recording update (2026-07-09): Manual meeting-recording upload + presigned playback + delete (branch
> `feat/p13-recording-upload`, FR-056 upload leg). **AC-073 (upload+playback) / AC-074 (delete) → Met.** File
> stored in MinIO via the shipped `IFileStore` seam (ADR-0014) under a server-derived key; playback via a
> short-lived pre-signed MinIO URL through nginx `/acmp-recordings/` (Host preserved so SigV4 validates);
> Secretary/Chairman upload/replace/delete, any member plays; size ≤ 2 GB (nginx + Kestrel raised). Delete
> removes the object (uploaded) or clears the reference (Webex). **ADR-0025** records the decision. Live-validated
> on `acmp.ngrok.dev` (real upload 200 through nginx — was 413 at the 1 MB default; presigned 200/206; delete →
> bucket empty). Traces: `MeetingRecordingTests` + `MeetingRecordingApiTests`. See progress-log "P13-recording" entry.

> P13-close update (2026-07-09): **P13 (Webex integration + meeting recording) closed.** All P13 ACs
> (AC-067–074) are `Met`. **AC-070's** live end-to-end leg is settled as an **environmental caveat, not a code
> gap**: the dev/sandbox Webex account used for validation here records **locally only** (no cloud
> `recordings/created` webhook), so a genuine cloud recording can't traverse the pipeline on this stack; the
> **production** (licensed) host cloud-records and would exercise it. The mechanism is proven live — webhook
> **auto-registration** (audit seq=46) and a **synthetic signed** `recordings/created` webhook → 200 → worker job
> → graceful drop — on top of the unit/integration attach tests. Residual = a one-time production live-confirm
> (tracked at deferred-work D-02). No AC downgraded.

> P12 audit-remediation update (2026-07-05): adversarial-audit fixes across Dashboards & Reports (branch
> `fix/p12-audit-remediation`), **NO AC flips** (AC-064/065/066 stay Met; PR3 Reports is AC-less). Fidelity +
> data-honesty only: the Reports **Stream filter now scopes decisions/actions** via their linked Topic (no card
> silently committee-wide — the audit's one MAJOR), plus per-series colour (Conditional→green, In-progress→accent,
> stream multicolor), en-dash aging labels, restored Exec KPIs, stat-card drill/footer, always-on filter row +
> real "Updated the elapsed-time value", refreshed empty copy, dead `p12Note` removed. `applyStreamFilter` moved to the pure
> `reportViews` + unit-tested. Design-update-owed logged (dashboards diverge by AC design; DATA-tabs/Period-Status
> filters/KPI-deltas removed) — reference must be refreshed (guardrail #14). See progress-log "P12 audit remediation".
>
> P12-PR2 update (2026-07-05): Role dashboards (FE, branch `feat/P12-pr2-role-dashboards`) —
> **AC-064/065/066 → Met.** One home page at `/` (`features/dashboard/RoleDashboard`) renders the variant for the
> signed-in user's highest committee role (Chairman > Secretary > else = Committee); the design's "Viewing as…" role
> tabs are a preview affordance, not a live control (release checklist F-19 = three distinct dashboards, one AC each).
> Every number is composed client-side (`dashboardAgg`) over the PR1 registers + existing reads — no server
> aggregation, no chart library (ADR-0022). The AC-carrying logic (bucketing, next-meeting pick, overdue-threshold,
> deferred≥2, SLA) lives in the pure `dashboardAgg.ts` and is unit-tested directly, so a wrong count can't hide
> behind a rendered heading. Traces: `dashboardAgg.test` (11) + `RoleDashboard.test` (14: role gating, per-variant
> live render, empty/loading/error, RTL chevron, axe). **Design→behavior reconciliations (guardrail #14, flagged):**
> the design's personalized member cards (My topics/actions/votes, Mentions) are NOT rendered — they are design
> extras, not required by any AC (AC-064 is committee-WIDE), and Mentions has no backing system; the committee
> variant shows the AC-064 data instead. AC-064's urgency breakdown + the committee recent-decisions/action-status
> cards and the chairman cards have no exact design card and reuse the design's segment/stat/list patterns.
> "Escalated actions" = overdue beyond the escalation threshold — **AC-065's own definition** (Actions have no
> Escalated status), one shared const feeds AC-065 + AC-066. Also removed the now-orphaned `components/ui/Card.tsx`
> (its only consumer was the placeholder dashboard). FE gates green: tsc, 802 vitest, per-file cov (global 99.80%),
> i18n parity 1364, oxlint, build. **Live `.dc.html` pixel-VR PASS** (`e2e/p12-dashboard-vr.spec.ts`, real login +
> API seed on the Docker stack): all three variants captured EN-light + AR-dark, pixel-faithful to
> `ACMP Dashboards & Reports.dc.html` — card anatomy/grid/typography/tokens, RTL mirroring (nav, segment bar,
> chevrons, badges), light/dark all correct; the populated Escalated-actions card confirms the AC-066 overdue
> threshold end-to-end. Cards left empty (SLA/triage/votes/risks/deferred) are fresh-stack seeding limits, not
> fidelity gaps. See progress-log "P12-PR2".
>
> P12-PR1 update (2026-07-05): Reporting thin registers (backend reads, branch `feat/P12-pr1-report-reads`) —
> **NO AC flips.** PR1 is backend enablement for the P12 role dashboards: `GET /api/decisions` + `GET /api/votes`
> registers, `GET /api/minutes` InReview approval queue, and a `Topic.TimesDeferred` counter on the backlog
> projection (migration `Topics_AddTimesDeferred`). **AC-064/065/066 (FR-135/136/137) stay Pending** — they flip to
> Met in **PR2** when the dashboards render this data end-to-end through the UI (G-TRACE: an AC is Met only when
> demonstrable, not when its data source exists). Right-sizing recorded in **ADR-0022** (no columnstore read-model
> layer, no chart library; resolves OQ-022). +6 backend tests (decisions/votes/minutes registers, TimesDeferred);
> Application 679 + Domain 188 green; format clean. See progress-log "P12-PR1".
>
> P11 audit-remediation update (2026-07-05): adversarial-audit fixes across the Governance surfaces (branch
> `fix/p11-audit-remediation`), **NO AC flips** (Governance is PH-2, AC-less). Design-fidelity: superseded-body
> dimming (+ removed a false `is-retired` comment), Superseded chip tone `warn`→`neutral`, `shieldPlus`/`book`/
> `filterLines`/`checklist` glyphs, shared Invariant H1, `nav`+`aria-current` tab bar, Convert-to-ADR primary CTA +
> preview box, supersede left-arrow/badge, numeric metrics + sticky aside, "Showing N", dead-code/comment cleanup
> (EN/AR parity 1310/1310). Backend robustness: **BE1 `Governance_AdrSourceDecisionUnique`** filtered unique index

> P11b update (2026-07-04): ADR **UI** — the `/adrs` register + `/adrs/:key` MADR-lite detail + create dialog
> (branch `feat/P11b-adr-ui`), **FE-only, NO AC flips** (Governance is PH-2, AC-less). Advances the UI half of

> P11e update (2026-07-04): Decision→ADR promotion (FR-068) — full-stack, branch `feat/P11e-decision-to-adr`, **NO
> AC flips** (Governance PH-2/AC-less; traces to **FR-068**, now done). The Chairman promotes an **Issued** decision

> traces to **FR-106/107** (create Category/Scope/Statement/Rationale/Owner + lifecycle Draft→Proposed→Active→

> P5-review remediation (2026-06-27): acted on the pre-advance P5 audit — fixed all flagged design-fidelity

> keyboard alternative for *status* moves, not the AC's priority-ordinal reorder — BL-039/BL-041 deferred).
> Shared primitives already matching the Design System (button 38/9, input 38, segmented 30) were left

> See progress-log P5-review remediation.

> P6a update (2026-06-27): Meetings module backend (domain → application → infrastructure → API) — agenda
> building, meeting scheduling/lifecycle, attendance, discussion, actual-time (W5–W9), plus the cross-module
> `ITopicScheduler` seam (Prepared→Scheduled on publish, Scheduled→InCommittee on start; idempotent,

> (Domain 42 · Architecture 12 · Application 314 · Api 20); ArchUnit enforces Meetings⟂Topics⟂Membership.
> **AC-044 Pending→Partial** — the backend reorder (`MoveAgendaItem` ±1 + `Agenda.MoveItem`, the path
> keyboard move-up/-down drives) is built + tested; the keyboard-accessible **agenda reorder UI** lands in
> P6c (same backend-then-UI split as AC-043). **AC-051/053 stay Pending → P6b** (in-app Notifications backend:

> `ICommitteeDirectory`). **AC-011** (presenter meeting-window enforcement) stays Partial → its UI/runtime
> path. Live SQL migration apply + an authenticated `/api/meetings` round-trip are the optional P6 tail.
> See progress-log P6a entry.

> P6b update (2026-06-27): in-app Notifications module (the AC-051/053 floor) + the publish/schedule fan-out.
> New `Notifications` module (`Notification` entity + `InAppNotificationChannel` = the v1 `INotificationChannel`,
> synchronous write; `GET /api/notifications` + mark-read scoped to the current user with an IDOR guard) and the

> AC-058). `ScheduleMeeting`/`PublishAgenda` now fan out one bilingual notification per active member; the
> `AgendaPublished` body carries the meeting date + agenda title and a deep link to the agenda view (AC-051
> content contract). Backend 397/397 (Domain 42 · Architecture 16 · Application 319 · Api 20); ArchUnit enforces
> Notifications isolation + a no-assembly-edge Meetings→Notifications seam. **AC-051 / AC-053 Pending → Partial**

> **AC-052** stays Pending (the deep-link mechanism exists; the vote-open notification is raised in P9).
> See progress-log P6b entry.

> P6c update (2026-06-27): Agenda builder UI (the design's agenda tab) wired to the Meetings API + a read-only
> meetings list. `api/meetings.ts` (read-by-key / mutate-by-id hooks), `features/meetings/AgendaBuilder.tsx`
> (pool from Prepared topics, drop-zone agenda, timebox stepper, presenter Select from /api/members, time-budget
> bar, publish dialog) and `MeetingsList.tsx`, composed from the shared library, logical-CSS RTL-safe, full
> EN+AR `meetings.*` namespace (parity 344). **AC-044 Partial → Met** — the keyboard-accessible reorder
> (move-up/-down → ±1, disabled at ends, aria-live announce) is shipped + unit-tested, jsdom axe clean. Web
> 151/151 (incl. 2 axe AA cases on the new screens), tsc + build + oxlint clean. The design's Preview button /
> notify-group toggles / RTE are mock chrome (disabled/honest-static); scheduling a NEW meeting is deferred
> (committee/chair pickers; committeeId not exposed). Live browser pass (real API, AR/RTL+dark, live axe)
> recommended — needs a scheduled meeting. AC-051/053 stay Partial → P6e. See progress-log P6c entry.

> P6d update (2026-06-27): live meeting workspace UI (the design's meeting tab) — agenda spine, attendance
> (present/absent → POST /attendance), discussion notes (→ POST /discussion), actual-time + outcome (→ POST
> /actual-time), the start/end lifecycle, and the in-page Tabs hosting both the agenda builder (P6c) and the
> workspace under `/meetings/:key`. Record-decision/create-action/call-vote are disabled stubs (P7/P8/P9); MoM
> is P7. **No verdict flips** — this is the UI for the W7–W9 workflows whose ACs are already covered by the P6a
> backend; the new screens add a surface to the localization/a11y ACs (AC-040/045/046 render RTL + axe-clean in
> the component tests; AC-041 stays Partial → VR P17). Web 168/168 (incl. a workspace axe AA case), parity 389,

> recommended — needs a scheduled+published meeting. AC-051/053 stay Partial → P6e. See progress-log P6d entry.

> P6e update (2026-06-27): notification center wired to the live `/api/notifications` feed + the unread bell
> badge. `api/notifications.ts` (feed + mark-read, 30s poll), `NotificationCenter.tsx` (live list, unread
> styling, click → mark-read + close + deep-link navigation, calm empty state preserved), `TopBar.tsx` (badge
> only when unread>0). **AC-051 Partial → Met** (end-to-end: P6b fan-out → the center renders the date/title/
> deep-link item + badge, deep link navigates) and **AC-053 Partial → Met** (single in-app channel, no email/
> Webex). **AC-052 Pending → Partial** (the deep-link navigation mechanism is proven; the vote-open trigger is
> P9). Web 177/177 (incl. a panel axe AA case), parity 393, tsc + build + oxlint clean, CSS RTL-safe. No
> `.dc.html` reference exists for the live list (planning doc docs/domain/information-architecture.md p.79 only) — composed from the shell's
> notif-* styles. Live cross-session browser pass recommended. See progress-log P6e entry.

> P6 follow-up (2026-06-27): the deferred meeting-schedule flow is built (ScheduleMeetingDialog +
> useScheduleMeeting; MeetingsList "Schedule meeting" action), and its blocker removed — the committee is now
> implicit server-side (`Meeting.SingleCommitteeId`; `CommitteeId` dropped from ScheduleMeetingCommand, a
> never-read field, no ADR). Chair picked from /api/members (defaults to Chairman). **No verdict flips** —
> meeting scheduling (W5) has no dedicated AC; this makes the P6 loop reachable end to end. Backend 397/397
> (command change carried through Domain/Application/Api), web 182/182 (incl. a dialog axe AA case), parity 412,
> dotnet format + tsc + build + oxlint clean. Live schedule round-trip recommended. See progress-log P6 follow-up.

> P6 live + hardening (2026-06-27): the full P6 loop was driven live (rebuilt stack, real Keycloak PKCE, AR/RTL)
> and 3 findings fixed — CSP `font-src 'self' data:`; a **filtered** unique email index so JIT provisions
> emailless Keycloak users (was a 500); and a **real P6b fan-out bug** (the shared owned-`LocalizedString`
> instance 500'd the notification for the 2nd+ recipient — broke notifications for any committee with ≥2
> members), fixed in `InAppNotificationChannel` with a unit + 2-member integration regression. **AC-051/052-shape/
> AC-053 are now LIVE-verified end to end:** scheduling MTG-2026-003 → the current member's notification center
> shows the bilingual item + a "1 unread" bell badge → clicking marks-read (badge clears) and follows the deep
> link. AC-051/053 stay **Met** (now with live proof); **AC-052** stays **Partial** (the deep-link *navigation*
> is proven live; the vote-open *trigger* is P9). Backend 407/407. See progress-log "P6 hardening".

> P3 foundation refresh (2026-06-27): reconciled the token/component/shell/nav foundation to the *updated*
> design references (Design System / ACMP shell / Navigation & IA). Tokens already matched verbatim; targeted
> drift fixes — StatusChip restored to DS §08 24/9/12 (+ `sm` 22/8/11.5 for table rows), TopBar "Ctrl K" search
> hint + real Ctrl/⌘+K focus, brand-word 15 / icon-btn 36 / chip-btn 36, notification popover r13/top46 +

> Touches **AC-040/045/046** (RTL/focus/labels — unit + axe still green) and **AC-041** (stays Partial →
> automated VR P17). Web 184/184, tsc+build clean (JS 173.98 kB gz), oxlint clean; live bundle verified to
> carry the reconciled CSS. Live authenticated pass done on desktop (EN-light + AR-RTL-dark, real Keycloak

> tablet) covered by the same token/logical-CSS mechanism; automated pixel-diff VR → P17. See progress-log
> "P3 foundation refresh".

> DV-04 rich-text unification (2026-07-01): unified the three divergent rich-text surfaces (Submit-topic
> inert toolbar, Meeting-notes functional markdown, Minutes deferred) into one shared `MarkdownEditor`
> (markdown stored as text). Closes AM-06 / rebuild-findings §8.3. No AC verdict flips (editor mechanism +

> FE 402 green; EN/AR parity 0 drift. See progress-log "DV-04".

> P6b Notifications IA reconcile (2026-06-30): reconciled the bell popover + full inbox to the design
> references (`ACMP.dc.html` L92–131 + L706–739) — `role="dialog"` popover with `{n} new` pill, Unread/All
> tabs, loading skeleton, tone-icon · artifact-key · time · message rows + per-item mark-read, View-all
> footer; inbox channel line + Unread/All underline tabs with counts + TYPE-label rows + Mark-read pills,

> `Notifications.AllRead` AuditEvent after persistence (reverses P6e's no-audit for the bulk sweep; single
> mark-read stays un-audited — **signed off 2026-07-01 as OQ-044**, the asymmetry is intentional and clarifies
> ADR-0009) — **type = existing `Category`, key derived from `DeepLink`** (no migration,
> no DTO change). **No verdict flips** — AC-051/053 stay **Met**, now exercised through the reconciled
> components; AC-052 stays Partial (vote-open notification → P9). FE 397 green + per-file lines ≥95%; BE
> Application 420 + Api 5 green (read-all both branches + user-scoped); EN/AR parity (0 drift); dev-stub VR
> (EN-light + AR-RTL-dark) matches. See progress-log "P6b (Notifications IA)".

> P4 UI refresh (2026-06-27): rebuilt Administration → Users & Membership to the updated
> `ACMP Administration.dc.html` — 7-tab strip (Users active, six later-phase placeholders disabled), richer
> directory (committee `.adm-mchip` chips with `×` + inert dashed `+add` + read-only voting switch, assignments
> check + honest `—`, per-row view button) and a new **read-only user-detail** panel (in-place, API-backed data
> only — no invite). **Removed** the "Provision via Keycloak" button + the invite panel (conflicts ADR-0015,
> manual Keycloak provisioning → **OQ-042**). **No verdict flips** — visual/fidelity + a read-only view.
> **AC-059** stays **Met** (directory + detail unit-tested + axe-clean). Touches **AC-040/045/046** (the admin
> screens render RTL-mirrored + axe-clean in the component tests) and **AC-041** (stays Partial → automated VR
> P17). Web 189/189 (incl. directory + detail axe AA cases), i18n parity 427, tsc + vite build + oxlint clean,
> administration.css grep = zero physical properties. Live authenticated VR (8 combos vs the `.dc.html`) is the
> recommended confirmatory step — blocked on the operator setting the `acmp-admin` dev password. See progress-log
> "P4 UI refresh".

> P5 UI refresh (2026-06-27): rebuilt Topics & Backlog to the updated `ACMP Backlog & Topic.dc.html` — new shared
> `FilterChip` dropdowns (Status multi; Type/Urgency single; Stream/Owner disabled — no option source yet), the
> accent saved-view chip, and the previously "coming soon" **calendar** and **timeline** now render as first-class
> live views with **faithful chrome + an honest empty body** (no scheduled/due/span data in the Topics API → P6;
> D1). Submit gains an inert RTE toolbar; Topic detail is now **5 tabs** (Overview · Discussion · **Attachments**
> own tab + post-create upload · **Votes** empty → P9 · History). **No verdict flips** — visual/fidelity + honest-
> empty new views. Touches **AC-040/045/046** (new chips/calendar/timeline/tabs render RTL-mirrored + axe-clean in
> the component tests) and **AC-041** (stays Partial → automated VR P17); **AC-057** aging badge unchanged.
> Web 197/197 (incl. FilterChip + new-view + new-tab axe/behavior cases), i18n parity 438, tsc + vite build +
> oxlint clean, topics.css + controls.css grep = zero physical properties. **Live authenticated VR DONE**
> (2026-06-27): real Keycloak PKCE pass over the rebuilt stack visually verified all 5 new surfaces (filter chips,
> calendar, timeline, submit RTE, detail 5 tabs) in EN-light + AR-dark + tablet-768 (no overflow; full RTL mirror
> + dark tokens); doubles as the E2E smoke pass. Automated pixel-diff VR → P17. See progress-log "P5 UI refresh".

> P6 Meetings list redesign (2026-06-29): rebuilt the meetings list to the design's `isList` screen
> (`ACMP Meetings.dc.html`) — an **Upcoming/Past** split (two shared `Table`s, columns
> ID·When·Title·Type·Status) with a **List⇄Calendar** toggle, plus a new `MeetingsCalendar` month grid
> (Intl month/weekday labels, RTL-mirrored prev/next, status-toned event pills over real
> `scheduledStart`, defaults to current month). The old single flat table was drift from this known
> reference, not no-design scaffolding. Operator GO "Match design, keep agenda chip": **kept** an
> Agenda-status chip column the design omits (deliberate deviation), **omitted** the mock's
> filter chips + Saved-views (no backend — not faked). Frontend-only; no API change. **No verdict
> flips** — a new view over existing meeting data, no dedicated AC. Adds a surface to
> **AC-040/045/046** (both screens render EN/AR + axe-clean, 0 violations across the two meetings
> specs; computed-px gate confirms every list + calendar literal matches the `.dc.html`) and
> **AC-041** (RTL mirror live-confirmed EN/AR desktop + AR tablet; automated pixel-diff VR → P17).
> Web 223/223 (incl. MeetingsCalendar + list-split/toggle axe + behaviour cases), i18n parity OK,
> tsc + vite build (JS 180 kB gz) + oxlint clean, meetings.css zero physical properties. See
> progress-log "Meetings list to design".

> P6 Create-meeting UI fixes (2026-06-29): visual pass over `/meetings/new` (design `isCreate`) fixed
> real defects — a global `.field + .field` margin double-counted the schedule card's flex gap (32px
> rhythm) and pushed the 2nd field of every two-column row 16px down (Ends/Mode misaligned); the Mode
> segmented didn't fill its cell. One scoped CSS reset → uniform 16 + top-aligned rows; Mode now
> `width:100%`. Operator GO: replaced native `datetime-local` (rendered mm/dd/yyyy under RTL) with the
> design's Date + Start/End times — a new shared **`DateField`** (trigger + calendar icon → `DatePicker`
> popover, Intl labels) + native `<input type=time>`; meeting is single-day (start/end share the date).
> Frontend-only, same `ScheduleMeeting` payload — **no verdict flips**. Touches **AC-040/045/046**
> (form renders EN/AR + axe-clean; live computed-px gate: gaps 16, rows aligned, Mode 310==cell) and
> **AC-041** (RTL mirror live-confirmed EN/AR incl. the date popover; pixel-diff VR → P17). Web 225/225
> (new DateField + date-required tests), parity OK, tsc + build + oxlint clean. See progress-log
> "Create-meeting screen UI fixes".

> P6a Meetings IA reconcile (2026-06-30): refactored the meeting detail into a **shell** (header card +
> 6-tab deep-linkable `NavLink` strip + `<Outlet/>`) over nested routes — index `MeetingOverview`,
> `/agenda` `AgendaBuilder`, `/attendance`+`/notes` `MeetingConduct` (→ `MeetingWorkspace` while

<!-- KEYSTONE — the AC cells below MUST stay BARE (`| AC-001 |`). Do NOT bold them.
     Corrected 2026-07-17 (P17a). The previous comment here asserted the exact opposite — that bold was
     "load-bearing" and un-bolding would re-create 74 duplicate-definition findings and fail G-IDS. That is
     FALSE, and acting on it shipped `main` NOT READY on a critical gate from e15cfff (2026-07-16) until this
     fix. Verified, not reasoned:
       * G-IDS ALREADY special-cases this file BY NAME and never scans its tables for definitions —
         validate_package.py:428-436: `audit_view = "acceptance-audit" in pf.rel.lower()` then
         `for table in pf.tables: if audit_view: continue`. So these cells can never be a second definition,
         bold or bare, and _guess_id_column is never reached for this file. The prior comment cited that
         function correctly but missed the caller's skip six lines above it.
       * G-PROGRESS has NO such skip: it parses these tables (validate_package.py:968-988) and matches each
         id cell with `cell.strip().strip("`")` + ID_TOKEN_RE.fullmatch — which strips BACKTICKS ONLY, never
         asterisks. So `**AC-001**` fails fullmatch => zero verdicts found => all 74 ACs report
         "not represented in the acceptance audit (coverage gap)" => RESULT: NOT READY.
     Empirically confirmed across commits: 11c6372 (bare) OK -> e15cfff (bolded) NOT READY -> bare again OK,
     7/7 critical gates PASS. If a future gate ever seems to want bold here, RUN the validator both ways
     before changing it. -->
<!-- Do NOT link the ids either (`[AC-001](acceptance-criteria.md#ac-001)`): the criteria register has no
     per-AC headings, so that ships 74 broken anchors. Backticks are stripped and change nothing. -->

Logout button added (TopBar) and verified end-to-end (dashboard → /login). Automated UI regression now landed — auth.spec (S6a) asserts the unauthenticated deep-link→/login guard and the real Keycloak PKCE round-trip → authenticated dashboard, in CI on the live stack |
| AC-002 | Auth & Identity | Met | KeycloakRoleClaimMapperTests + MembershipFeatureTests + MembershipApiTests (/me) | Claim→Secretary mapped; JIT profile gets the role end-to-end |

| AC-012 | SoD-1 | Partial | SegregationOfDutiesTests + ActionHandlerTests (owner-verify denied + `ActionVerifyDenied` audit, stays Completed) + ActionsApiTests (owner verify → 403, HTTP) + ActionActions.test (Verify hidden from owner/completer; server 403 surfaced without closing the dialog) | P8a: the SoD-1 gate is enforced in `VerifyActionHandler` — the owner's verify attempt is audited then refused (403). P8b2a: the Verify UI hides the button from the owner/completer (client SoD-1 convenience gate) and surfaces the API 403; the API stays the real gate. Live real-stack (Keycloak PKCE + SQL) leg → P17 |
| AC-013 | SoD-1 | Met | SegregationOfDutiesTests + ActionHandlerTests (independent verifier → Verified + `ActionVerified` audit) + ActionsApiTests (third-party verify → 204, Verified) + ActionActions.test (a non-owner verifier sees + triggers Verify → `useVerifyAction`) + p17b-actions.spec.ts (live real-stack: a chairman owns + completes an action, then the secretary — a different sub — opens it and drives Verify in the UI → 204 → the action reaches Verified) | P8a: the positive verify path (verifier ≠ owner ≠ completer) transitions Completed→Verified, stamps the verifier, notifies the owner. P8b2a: a non-owner verifier's Verify button POSTs `/actions/{id}/verify`. **Met** flip: the live UI verify leg passed (P17b, 2026-07-17) — a genuinely non-owner/non-completer secretary clicks Verify and the action reaches Verified through the real stack (SoD-1 positive). Satisfies the live-leg rule ([definition-of-done.md](../execution/definition-of-done.md) §The live-leg rule). From Partial → Met (P17b, 2026-07-17). |
| AC-014 | SoD-2 | Partial | MinutesHandlerTests (sole-author approval allowed + flagged; different approver clears the flag) + MinutesApiTests (sole-author publish → ApprovedBySoleAuthor) + MeetingMinutes.test (published record renders read-only) | P7c: soft SoD-2 flag + `ApprovedBySoleAuthor`; P7d: the minutes tab renders the approved/published record; live real-stack UI → P17 |
| AC-015 | SoD-3 | Partial | SegregationOfDutiesTests + VoteHandlerTests (chair counted the vote → issue 403 + audited denial; vote stays Closed, not ratified) | P9a: the SoD-3 GATE is now enforced on the decision-issue path — the issuing chair may not be the vote's counter of record (Option A). Live real-stack → P17 |
| AC-016 | SoD-3 | Partial | SegregationOfDutiesTests + DecisionHandlerTests (override + justification + flag) + VoteHandlerTests (secretary counted → chair issue allowed + vote Ratified) | P9a: the co-attestation GATE is now wired — a secretary-counted vote lets the chair issue + ratify; a chair-counted vote is refused (AC-015). Live real-stack → P17 |
| AC-017 | Audit | Met | AuditAtomicityTests (enriched before/after populated end-to-end on real SQL) + AuditApiTests (register surfaces normalized v1+v2 rows, entityType/actor filters, paginated) + the PR2 per-module emit-site migration to `EmitEnrichedAsync` | Write side (PR2): every governed state change emits an enriched v2 row (action/subjectType=CLR name/subjectId/actorUserId/actorRole/outcome/before/after/correlationId). Read side (PR3): `GET /api/audit` returns the filtered/paged register. DB-permission immutability shipped P16a (migration `Audit_DenyMutation`, ADR-0031) — DB refuses UPDATE/DELETE on `schema::audit` for the least-priv `acmp_app` role (`AuditImmutabilityDbPermissionTests`); **effective once the app runs least-priv, not `sa` → P18 operator residual** |
| AC-018 | Audit | Met | AuditEventEnrichmentTests (valid v1→v2 chain verifies; enriched-field tamper flagged with the correct `Reason`) + AuditEvent design (no public setters, no Update/Delete path; SaveChanges only Adds) + UNIQUE `PreviousHash`/`Hash` non-forking indexes | Immutable by construction — the row has no mutation surface, so tamper is detectable (verifier) rather than possible. A DB-level UPDATE/DELETE-blocking grant for out-of-app/DBA writes shipped P16a (migration `Audit_DenyMutation`, ADR-0031; proven under a restricted login), effective after the P18 least-priv-login switch |
| AC-019 | Audit | Met | AuditEventEnrichmentTests (tamper → `Verify` reports non-null `BrokenAtSequence` with `Reason`) + AuditApiTests (`GET /api/audit/verify` → {IsValid, BrokenAtSequence, Reason} over an intact chain, RBAC-gated) | On-demand chain-verify endpoint. Nightly Hangfire verify job (C-INS-02) shipped P16a — `IIntegrityVerifier` (`Acmp.Worker` `Cron.Daily(3)`) re-verifies the audit chain **and** every sealed vote's ballot chain + tally, alerting via Serilog + a durable `AuditEvent` (`IntegrityVerifierTests`, ADR-0030) |
| AC-020 | Audit | Met | AuditApiTests (Auditor/Chairman/Secretary → 200; Member/Reviewer/**Administrator** → 403; no token → 401 — on both `/api/audit` and `/api/audit/verify`) | Auditor read gated by `Policies.AuditRead` = {Auditor, Chairman, Secretary}; Administrator excluded on SoD-5 (ADR-0027 supersedes the FR-153 role clause). PR4: the `/audit` register UI (AuditRegister + AuditRegister.test) renders the read-only trail; `App.tsx` route-gates `/audit` to {auditor, chairman, secretary} and `navModel` drops administrator — the FE gate matches the API policy |
| AC-021 | Voting | Met | VoteTests + VoteHandlerTests (Open locks config + present-quorum via the seam + VoteOpened fan-out) + VotesApiTests + p17b-meeting-vote.spec.ts (live real-stack: the secretary calls a vote from the in-session MeetingWorkspace's CallVoteDialog, configures the eligible voters + quorum, then opens it on the vote page — the config locks and the roster is exactly the two voting-eligible members) | P9a: config locks at Open, present-quorum gate (live-attendance seam), eligible voters notified (deep link /votes/{key}). **Met** flip: the live configure→open leg passed (P17b, 2026-07-17) — the CallVoteDialog configures a meeting-linked vote and the vote page opens it (present quorum met by two Present eligible members); the opened vote rosters exactly its eligible voters. The eligible-voter deep-link notification is proven separately by AC-052; "only eligible can cast" is API/domain-enforced (VotesApiTests). Satisfies the live-leg rule ([definition-of-done.md](../execution/definition-of-done.md) §The live-leg rule). From Partial → Met (P17b, 2026-07-17). |
| AC-022 | Voting | Partial | VoteTests (second cast throws) + VoteHandlerTests (double-vote audited denial `Decisions.BallotDenied`) + VotesApiTests (2nd cast → 409) | P9a: one ballot/voter — first ballot unchanged, denial audited, DB unique-index backstop. Live → P17 |
| AC-023 | Voting | Met | VoteHandlerTests + VotesApiTests (GetVoteByKey returns attributed ballots, no masking) + p17b-voting.spec.ts (live real-stack: a chairman genuinely casts a ballot, the secretary closes the vote, then the closed roster renders that ballot attributed to the chairman by name + choice — never anonymized, ADR-0010) | P9a: ballots attributed by name in the detail DTO + aggregate tally. **Met** flip: the live closed-roster leg passed (P17b, 2026-07-17) — a real cast chairman ballot renders attributed (name + choice) on the closed VotePage viewed by the secretary. Satisfies the live-leg rule ([definition-of-done.md](../execution/definition-of-done.md) §The live-leg rule). From Partial → Met (P17b, 2026-07-17). |
| AC-024 | Voting | Met | VoteTests (close cast-quorum guard) + VoteHandlerTests + VotesApiTests (close-without-quorum → 409, stays Open) + p17b-voting.spec.ts (live real-stack: the secretary opens a vote with 0 casts below MinCast, clicks Close in the UI → server rejects → the vote stays Open with an inline announced error) | P9a: "Quorum not met: {cast} of {MinCast}"; vote stays Open. **Met** flip: the live UI close-below-quorum leg passed (P17b, 2026-07-17) — the secretary's Close click is rejected and VotePage surfaces the announced error with the vote still Open (Fork 2). Satisfies the live-leg rule ([definition-of-done.md](../execution/definition-of-done.md) §The live-leg rule). From Partial → Met (P17b, 2026-07-17). |
| AC-025 | Voting | Partial | VoteTests (no mutators post-Close; re-transition throws) + VotesApiTests (cast-after-close → 409) | P9a: immutable after Close (frozen tally/ballots). Crypto hash-chain — **delivered in P16a**, not deferred: per-ballot SHA-256 chain sealed at `Vote.Close` + tally recompute (`BallotChain`, ADR-0030, closes D-13). *(This note previously read "→ P14", a stale pointer — P14 is Tarseem/diagrams and never carried this work; corrected 2026-07-17 when P14 was deferred via DEC-028, which would otherwise have implied a shipped control was deferred indefinitely.)* **Verdict unchanged — still Partial**: the residual is the live leg → P17 |
| AC-026 | Voting | Partial | VoteTests (forward-only; Ratify only from Closed) | P9a: Configured→Open→Closed→Ratified strictly forward-only. Live → P17 |
| AC-027 | Decisions | Partial | DecisionTests (no-mutator / re-issue + re-supersede throw) + DecisionHandlerTests + DecisionsApiTests (issue→Issued) + DecisionPage.test (read-only detail, no edit surface) | Domain immutability + issue path proven; P7b renders the read-only detail (no edit affordance); live HTTP/UI confirmation → P17 (G-TRACE) |
| AC-028 | Decisions | Met | DecisionTests (Supersede back-link) + DecisionHandlerTests (successor Issued, prior Superseded, both readable, prior unchanged) + DecisionsApiTests (supersede 201 + prior back-link) + DecisionPage.test (superseded badge/banner + supersede dialog → POST /supersede) + p17b-decisions.spec.ts (live real-stack: an Issued decision is superseded via the SupersedeDialog → 201, navigates to the readable successor, and the prior flips to Superseded with its statement intact) | Both readable + prior unchanged proven. **Met** flip: the live supersede round-trip passed (P17b, 2026-07-17) — the SupersedeDialog creates a successor and marks the prior Superseded, both readable. Two honest notes: (1) the UI actor is the **Chairman** — supersede is `DecisionChairApprove` (Chairman-only); the AC's "Secretary" wording predates that authz, tracked as a product↔criterion nuance (OQ candidate). (2) The `SupersededByDecisionId` **back-link is deliberately NOT rendered** (the prior's DTO carries only the successor Guid, flagged in `DecisionPage`), so that specific field stays on its API/unit proof (DecisionsApiTests, DecisionTests); the E2E adds the user-facing round-trip + Superseded-state legs. Satisfies the live-leg rule ([definition-of-done.md](../execution/definition-of-done.md) §The live-leg rule). From Partial → Met (P17b, 2026-07-17). |
| AC-029 | Decisions | Met | DecisionHandlerTests (follow-up outcome + no link → rejected, stays Draft; non-follow-up exempt; `RequiresDownstreamLink` theory over all 11 outcomes) + DecisionsApiTests (P8d: `/issue` 409 + stays Draft, then link → 204; Rejected exempt → 204) | **P8d (OQ-045 resolved):** follow-up-bearing outcomes (Approved/ConditionallyApproved/EnhancementsRequired/DesignChangesRequired/ResearchRequired) reject `/issue` with 409 unless ≥1 downstream link; gate lives in `IssueDecisionHandler` (cross-module count via Actions-owned `IActionLinkDirectory`, not a domain guard), so supersession auto-exempts (ASM-014). "Downstream link" = ≥1 ActionItem sourced from the decision until Risk/Traceability land (P10, ADR-0008). **P10c widened the gate** (still Met, superset): satisfied by ≥1 linked Action (`IActionLinkDirectory`) OR ≥1 curated downstream traceability edge (`ITraceabilityLinks` — decision as source of recorded-as/resolves or target of implements; upstream/lineage excluded, ASM-P10c-2). New DecisionsApiTests case proves the edge-only path issues |

The backend **priority-ordinal persist** (`SetPriority`) is now adversarially tested in S1 (ordinal set + audited, immutable-topic guard, `Backlog.Prioritize` authz-deny). The AC's literal **UI move-up/down wired to the persisted ordinal** (BL-039 within-column reorder, BL-041) is still **not yet built** — deferred to a follow-up slice.

Unit-tested + jsdom axe clean; the recommended live browser pass now lands — the native drag-reorder is exercised on the real browser (S6b-2) and live axe AA is clean in EN/AR (S6b-3). From Partial (P6c, 2026-06-27). |

| AC-049 | File upload | Partial | TopicAttachmentTests (validator) + SubmitTopic.test (size reject) | Server size/MIME rejection (400); submit form adds a 50 MB client-side pre-check with a localized message; server-side localized message → BL-016 |
| AC-050 | File upload | Met | TopicAttachmentTests (handler) + live (POST /{id}/attachments → 201 on real MinIO) | Submit UI stages a file and POSTs multipart to the new topic; live pass confirmed 201 against real MinIO (handler does IFileStore store + SQL metadata + DocumentAttached audit) |

The standing cross-session caveat now lands — core-loop.spec (S6b-1) publishes an agenda and verifies the unread bell in TWO separate live browser contexts (member + chairman), confirming the ≥2-member fan-out end-to-end. From Partial (P6e, 2026-06-27). |

P9a raises the **vote-open** (`VoteOpened`) notification — one per eligible voter. **Met** flip: the live one-click deep-link leg passed (P17b, 2026-07-17) — a genuine eligible-voter member receives the VoteOpened in their notification center and one click lands them on the voting UI with no extra steps. Satisfies the live-leg rule ([definition-of-done.md](../execution/definition-of-done.md) §The live-leg rule). From Partial → Met (P17b, 2026-07-17). |

- **Met (36):** AC-001/002/008/017/018/019/020/029/031/035/039/040/042/044/045/046/047/050/051/053/056/058/
  059/060/061/064/065/066/067/068/069/070/071/072/073/074.
- **Partial (37):** AC-003/005/006/007/009/010/011/012/013/014/015/016/021/022/023/024/025/026/027/028/030/
  032/033/034/036/037/038/041/043/048/049/052/054/055/057/062/063.
- **Pending (1):** AC-004 (Keycloak idle-timeout — needs a live realm session policy, OQ-003).
- **Resolved this cycle:** AC-060/061 Pending → **Met** (P15f/g global search: 5-provider `/api/search` fan-out + `/search` UI; SQL FTS + LIKE booster with the Arabic word-breaker lcid 1025, OQ-034 resolved). Evidence: `SearchApiTests` + `SearchPage.test` (AC-060), `SearchProvidersFtsTests` real-stack FTS (AC-061) — all present in-tree.

**Verification basis (not a fresh full-suite run):** each `Met` traces to the per-AC test refs above (G-TRACE)
and `main` is green at `68d90d4` (through P15h; P15f/g #118 passed all four CI checks incl. the full-stack **e2e**). **Honest caveats:** most
governance-feature `Partial`s (Voting AC-021–026, Decisions AC-027/028, MoM AC-036–038, Actions AC-012/013,
SoD AC-014/015/016, background jobs AC-054/055, traceability AC-062/063) carry a "live real-stack → P17" note —
their domain/handler/HTTP legs are unit+integration proven, the dedicated live real-stack VR leg is not yet
their own gate. **AC-070** (Webex recording attach) is `Met` with a settled environmental residual: the
mechanism is proven live (webhook auto-registration + a synthetic signed webhook), but a genuine **cloud**
recording end-to-end awaits a production licensed host (deferred-work D-02) — **not downgraded** (logged, ADR-
tracked). **Provenance of prior flips:** AC-043 Met→Partial (P5-review, kanban move covers status not the
priority-ordinal reorder); AC-035 Partial→Met (S6b-1 E2E + D-15 UI); AC-062/063 Pending→Partial (P10e panel UI,
reconciled here — the table cells had lagged the merged P10e verdict).

> **Test-hardening S1 (2026-06-29):** the AC→test mapping begins here. S1 adds **adversarial, failure-first
> backend coverage** (BE 89.1% → 97.6% lines, ADR-0016) for the Topics triage/edit handlers
> (Update/Defer/Prepare/Prioritize/Reject), the Meetings conduct/cancel/agenda-edit handlers
> (End/Cancel/RemoveAgendaItem) + their validators, and the Membership delegation validator — each asserting
> authz-deny, 404, domain status/immutability guards, and `AuditEvent` emission on real behaviour.
> **No verdict flips this slice:** per the standing G-TRACE rule an AC is `Met` only once its live HTTP/UI
> leg lands (→ P17), so S1 deepens the *evidence* behind the existing `Partial`/`Met` rows (AC-031/032/034/
> 035/043) without over-claiming. No business behaviour changed.

> **Test-hardening S2 (2026-06-29):** **adversarial, failure-first frontend coverage** of the auth + data
> layer (FE 83.74% → 94.83% lines; the whole S2 surface — `App.tsx`, `api/*`, `auth/*`, `LoginPage`,
> `AuthCallbackPage` — at **100% lines**, ADR-0016). 88 tests run the *real* OIDC providers, route/role
> guards, API client, and TanStack Query hooks against a stubbed `fetch` (the screen tests mock these away,
> so this is their first real exercise). This deepens the **client-side** evidence for **AC-001** (Keycloak
> claim→role mapping + auth-code/PKCE config now unit-tested) and the route/role gating noted in P3/P4
> (`ProtectedRoute`/`RequireRole`/route tree — UI gating, not authorization). **No verdict flips:** the live
> auth round-trip already carries AC-001 (P4/CHANGE-001); these are unit-level FE assertions and the
> automated UI-regression leg remains → P17. No product behaviour changed. Screen-state FE remainder → S4.

> **Test-hardening S3 (2026-06-29):** **adversarial backend coverage** that takes every backend file to
> **≥95% lines** (overall 97.6% → **99.6%**; Api assembly 94.7% → **100%**), so the per-file S7 gate can
> flip. 101 failure-first tests (458 → 559): HTTP round-trips over the real pipeline for the Topics/Meetings
> endpoints not previously exercised (defer/priority/update; agenda move/timebox/presenter; conduct
> attendance/discussion/actual-time; cancel — with 403/400 cases), plus domain/application/shared unit tests
> (Topic Close/Convert + events, TopicComment/TopicAttachment, MemberStreamAssignment/Delegation/
> CommitteeMember, AssignStreamsValidator, GetBacklog filter/sort branches, Notification, CurrentUserService,
> BaseEntity, LocalizedString, the ITopicScheduler seam). **No verdict flips** — the HTTP endpoint tests run
> the real authorization pipeline (deepening evidence for the Topics/Meetings workflow ACs) but the live
> end-to-end UI legs remain → P17. No exclusions added; no product behaviour changed.

> **Test-hardening S4 (2026-06-29):** **frontend screen-state coverage** taking every FE file to **≥95%
> lines** (global 94.83% → **98.46%**), so the per-file S7 gate is FE-ready. 121 tests (225 → 346) over the
> UI primitives (Pagination, Select/Dialog/Field/DateField/MultiSelect keyboard + edge paths), ErrorBoundary,
> PlaceholderPage, NotificationCenter states, meetingStatus, and feature gaps (SubmitTopic attachments/
> draft/autosave/submit-error; AgendaBuilder). Deepens FE-side evidence for the a11y/keyboard ACs but flips
> **no verdicts** — automated UI-regression remains → P17. **4 documented `/* v8 ignore */` comments**
> (comment-only, no behaviour change) cover genuinely browser-only paths jsdom can't run — @dnd-kit + native
> HTML5 **drag** (accessible Move up/down + click-to-add are unit-tested; drag → S6 E2E) and two defensive/
> unreachable guards. Both stacks now per-file-gate-ready (BE 99.6%, FE 98.46%).

> **Test-hardening S6b + S7 — E2E mandate complete + coverage gate live; AC reconciliation (2026-06-30):**
> S6a stood up the Playwright harness against the real compose stack (genuine Keycloak PKCE). **S6b** added
> the live functional E2E the InMemory/unit suites can never run — `core-loop.spec` (submit→accept→prepare→
> schedule→build→publish→notify→start→conduct→end, with the notify fan-out verified across two browser
> contexts), `dnd-and-failures.spec` (the S4-deferred native drag paths + failure-first authz/validation),
> and `rtl-a11y.spec` (live `dir=rtl` flip + axe AA on Backlog/Submit-Topic in EN+AR). **S7** wired the hard
> per-file ≥95%-lines coverage gate (FE+BE) into CI. **This is the slice where the long-standing "live HTTP/UI
> leg → P17" caveats finally land, so G-TRACE flips are now justified — but conservatively:**
> - **AC-035 Partial→Met** — the Accepted→Prepared transition's live HTTP leg now lands end-to-end in
>   `core-loop.spec` (UI accept → live-HTTP prepare → the prepared topic visibly flows into the live agenda
>   pool, is added + published). Per the project's own G-TRACE rule ("Met once the live HTTP/UI leg lands")
>   this is the one clean flip.
>   - **⚠ 2026-07-07 correction (tracked as [D-15](../execution/deferred-work-register.md)).** The "live HTTP
>     leg" above is a **direct HTTP** call in the E2E — **the SPA has no UI to mark a topic Prepared** (only
>     `accept`/`return` are wired). So in the product a Secretary/Owner **cannot** perform this step, no topic
>     reaches `Prepared`, and the agenda-builder pool is **permanently empty via the UI** (operator-reported).
>     The transition + `TopicPrepared` audit + scheduling-eligibility are genuinely Met **at the API**; the
>     **user-facing UI affordance is missing**. Verdict arguably **Partial** — flagged for operator decision;
>     the (frontend-only) remediation is scoped as high-priority **D-15**.
>     - **✅ 2026-07-09 resolved (D-15, Tier 3).** A **"Mark prepared"** button now ships on the Accepted-topic
>       detail (`TopicDetail.tsx`, `usePrepareTopic` invalidating backlog + prepared-pool + detail; show-and-
>       enforce with inline 403), plus a **Prepared** kanban badge and a reworded agenda empty-state. The
>       affordance is proven by component tests (the button calls `mutate`; the hook POSTs and invalidates the
>       prepared-pool key) **and end-to-end**: the `core-loop.spec` prepare leg was **switched from a direct-HTTP
>       call to clicking the button**, and the full spec was **run locally against the live stack and passes**
>       (the button click drives the prepare `204`, the prepared topic flows into the agenda pool, and the agenda
>       is added + published) — so the E2E now *drives* the affordance rather than masking its absence. CI's e2e
>       job re-validates on the PR. Backend W4-completeness: `PrepareTopicHandler` now notifies the **Secretary
>       roster** (skip-self); `TopicApiTests` exercises `POST /{id}/prepare` through the real pipeline so the new
>       DI seams are proven. The Verdict is **Met** — the API transition + audit + the UI affordance are all
>       tested, now genuinely driven by an E2E that clicks the button. Residual: no "un-prepare"/defer-from-
>       Prepared transition (tracked as **OQ-049**, applied default = defer).
> - **Caveats closed, no verdict change** (evidence strengthened on already-`Met` rows): **AC-001** (auth.spec
>   = the automated UI-regression that was "→ P17"); **AC-044** (the "recommended live browser axe/RTL pass" —
>   native drag-reorder on a real browser + live axe AA); **AC-051** (the "standing cross-session browser
>   pass" — publish fan-out verified in two live contexts).
> - **Deliberately NOT flipped** (honest scope — these gaps are not what functional E2E closes): **AC-041**
>   stays Partial — it needs an automated **pixel-diff visual-regression** suite (RTL *mirroring* correctness),
>   which functional E2E does not provide; the new live `dir=rtl`+axe evidence strengthens it but is not VR.
>   **AC-034/043/048/057** stay Partial — their gaps are **unbuilt UI** (topic-edit 403 UI, the priority-
>   ordinal within-column reorder UI) or future-phase work (beforeunload native dialog; SLA-breach
>   notification), not a missing test the E2E supplies. **No product behaviour changed in this slice** — it is
>   docs-only AC reconciliation against evidence that already merged (PRs #44–#48).

> P4 grading rule (G-TRACE): an auth AC is **Met** only when fully demonstrable against aggregates/stores
> that exist in P4 (claim→role, 401, Membership directory + deactivation). ACs whose *mechanism* is built and
> unit-tested but whose end-to-end demonstration needs a not-yet-built aggregate (Topics P5, Actions P8,
> Votes P9, MoM P7), endpoint, or the immutable audit store (BL-066) are **Partial**, with the consuming
> phase named. This avoids over-claiming: the policy/handler/predicate is proven now; the live HTTP path
> lands with its module.
